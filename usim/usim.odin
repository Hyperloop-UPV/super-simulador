/*
Procedure that will be called after starting up peripherals for a specific board.
Will be called once for every board dll which this usim is attached to.

Arguments:
 - `memory`: An already initialized ^peripherals.Memory, should not be written to, only read
 - `api`: The usim api, includes own functions but mostly to access [`Sim_subscribe_event`,`Sim_wait_event`,`Sim_add_event_watch`,`Sim_poll_event`]
 - `board_name`: The board name that was attached to the usim
 - `usim_mem`: A pointer to be filled in with the usim memory given to `Update_Proc` and `Deinit_Proc`, if it is the first call, `usim_mem^` will be nil (`*usim_mem`), else it will be a prevously returned value from Init_Proc
Returns:
 - If initialization succeeded

If this returns false, it won't be called again for any other boards

Procedure that will be called in a loop until `sim_is_done` is true.

Arguments:
 - `usim_mem`: rawptr (same as void*) to memory recieved from `Init_Proc`
Returns:
 - `end_early`: if end_early is true, `Update_Proc` will stop being called and `Deinit_Proc` will be called once

WARNING: This callback will be called in a different thread and it is separate from the event queue from `Event_Subscribe_Proc`.
         Use this sparingly because it will interrupt the board's running thread.

Arguments:
 - `id`: The usim id given by `Init_Proc`
